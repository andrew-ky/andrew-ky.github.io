                <p>Senior Survivor is a high school reality competition where 12 seniors live at school for a week, competing in challenges to raise money for When in Need West Ottawa (WINWO), a local community support organization.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Challenges and Solutions:</b> Managing both the fundraising logistics and the production of daily Survivor recap episodes was demanding. I implemented a structured workflow and delegated editing responsibilities to streamline execution. Staying at school late to edit while managing event operations led to burnout. Learning to trust my team and distribute tasks allowed for better time management and event efficiency.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Teamwork and Collaboration:</b>Worked with range of parties for a succsessful event. West Ottawa Student Senate organized the event logistics, games, and overall fundraising initatives. WOBN (West Ottawa Broadcasting Network) marketed and produced episodes daily increasing event visibility. Worked with school faculty and competitiors for community outreach and event execution.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Impact and Results:</b> Raised $29,499.92 in one year, over $80,000 in three yearsâ€”a record-breaking success. Strengthened school spirit and community involvement through immersive storytelling and competition. Learned effective leadership using delegation and trust, time management skills, and storytelling through media.</p>
