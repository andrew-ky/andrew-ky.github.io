                <p>When a headstrong teen with dreams of the big city finds out that a developer wants to buy her neighborhood, she must figure out how to outsmart the neighborhood committee head to convince her wacky cohousing community to sell, in order to get the cash to finance her goals. In the midst of the 25th Anniversary of Willowbrook Cohousing, she teams up with her crotchety old neighbor and eccentric younger brother to ruin the festivities and sway the vote in her favor.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cohousing is a low-budget indie short film that explores the tension and intimacy of a living community. As Producer and 1st Assistant Director, I oversaw all aspects of production from pre-production planning to post-production delivery.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Project Execution and Logistics:</b> Applied industry-standard practices in budgeting, shooting logistics, and contingency planning. Learned how to forecast risks and adapt on set when faced with inclement weather, talent delays, or creative pivots.</p>
                <p>Budget Management: Created and maintained an industry grade budget in Excel, tracking equipment rentals, expenses, catering, and production design. Being a low-budget indie production with a $4000 budget, the project was delivered 40% under budget by making data-driven decisions and reallocating resources efficiently.</p>
                <p> Shcheduling: Developed detailed call sheets and shooting schedules, allowing for time-conscious scene setups and resets. Reduced average turnaround time between scenes by 30% by streamlining crew communication.</p>
                <p> Production Coordination: Secured multiple shoot locations, coordinated transportation logistics, and ensured legal compliance with university and city filming regulations.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Teamwork and Collaboration:</b>Led a team of 20+ cast and crew members, facilitating communication between departments including camera, sound, art, and production design. Implemented daily briefings and problem-solving structures that kept morale high and production on schedule.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Impact and Results:</b> Final film was delivered on schedule and submitted to multiple film festivals. Premired in Ann Arbor's Michigan Theatre. Produced extensive production reports, wrap documentation, and marketing assets for future distribution. Gained hands-on insight into the producer-director relationship.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Leadership and Professional Development: </b>The project was advised by professor and notable screenwriter Jim Burnstein (Renaissance Man) and producer Emily Jade Foley (Nomadland). Under their mentorship, I learned to navigate the producerâ€™s role with a focus on story-driven logistics, balancing the creative vision with practical constraints. Their direct feedback helped sharpen my ability to make important decisions and communicate clearly with department heads.</p>
